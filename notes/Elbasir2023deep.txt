A deep learning approach reveals unex- plored landscape of viral expression in cancer

## Abstract

About 15% of human cancer cases are attributed to viral infections.
To date, virus expression in tumor tissues has been mostly studied by aligning tumor RNA sequencing reads to databases of known viruses.
To allow identification of divergent viruses and rapid characterization of the tumor virome, we develop viRNAtrap, an alignment-free pipeline to identify viral reads and assemble viral contigs.
We utilize viRNAtrap, which is based on a deep learning model trained to discriminate viral RNAseq reads, to explore viral expression in cancers and apply it to 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).
Using viRNAtrap, we uncover expression of unexpected and divergent viruses that have not previously been implicated in cancer and disclose human endogenous viruses whose expression is associated with poor overall survival.
The viRNAtrap pipeline provides a way forward to study viral infections associated with different clinical conditions.

## Idea

1. Train the model using HIV-1 viral sequences to build a HIV-1 specific viRNAtrap
2. Apply this model on pseudo-bulk/metacell CD4T cells of PLWHIV
3. Is this a way to estimate the latent reservoir?
4. Compared to existing methods to estimate HIV-1 latent reservoir or (CD4T) cell-associated RNA
5. Using the estimate HIV-1 reservoir to do association analysis, such as the elite vs non-elite PLWHIV.

## TO-DO

1. Is the scRNA-seq 3'? If so, the estimation of viral RNA could be less accurate.
2. Which one could be better, metacell or pseudo-bulk?
3. Check the Virus Variation Resource, are the HIV-1 viral sequences in good quality?
4. Is it a good idea to write a perspective summarizing the idea above?
